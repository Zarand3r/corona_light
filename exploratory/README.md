## `exploratory`

Any kind of preliminary analysis that you do should be done in your own
folder. If you do not have a folder, please create one using your first name
and all lowercase. We have no first name overlaps so this will make it
easy to identify everyone's work. Record any experiments or sandbox
adjustments you make to models in your folder. Feel free to also peruse
other researcher's exploratory folders to get ideas :)
