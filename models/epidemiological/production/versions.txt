Version 1.0:
============
Error bounds did not work properly

Version 2.0:
============
Fixed error bounding function
Created secondary error bounding function
If the first fails, use the second one
Second one might be better overall actually
Process "noncovergent" counties seperately
	Set predictions equal to the last observed value in perptuity, with crude error calculation
Fixed submission pipeline (formatting, converting to daily deaths)

Version 2.1:
============
Fix moving average
Fit Q to active cases

Version 2.2
===========
Refine initial guesses using Italy data
Use clustering to process "nonconvergent" counties?
Fit on different policy regimes
