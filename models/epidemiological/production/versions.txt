Version 1.0:
============
Error bounds did not work properly

Version 2.0:
============
Fixed error bounding function
Created secondary error bounding function
Fixed model_beyond
Fixed submission pipeline (formatting, converting to daily deaths)
Combine the two error methods. This option is when quick=False
	If the first fails, use the second one
Second one might be better overall actually
Process "noncovergent" counties seperately
	Set predictions equal to the last observed value in perptuity, with crude error calculation


Version 2.1:
============
Fix moving average
Refine initial guesses using Italy data
Fit on different policy regimess? Restrict parameters for saecond fit by making new simplified pecaiqr2


Version 2.2
===========
Use clustering to process "nonconvergent" counties?
Fit on different policy regimes


Version 3.0
===========

Fit Q to active cases
